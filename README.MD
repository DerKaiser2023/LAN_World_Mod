# LAN World Mod for Minecraft 1.7.10

## üìå Overview
This mod allows players to host and join LAN worlds over the internet by generating a unique invite code. Instead of requiring players to be on the same local network, this mod enables remote connections to LAN-hosted Minecraft games, making it easier for friends to play together.

## ‚ö° Features
- Generates an invite code when a LAN world is hosted.
- Allows players outside the local network to join using the invite code.
- Dynamically retrieves the public IP address of the host.
- Connects players automatically to the host's LAN world.
